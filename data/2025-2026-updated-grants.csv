New Jersey Monitor ,"The New Jersey Monitor is an independent, nonprofit and nonpartisan news site that strives to be a watchdog
for all residents of the Garden State.When policy makers are making decisions, our reporters will do more
than tell you what they’re doing. We’ll tell you why and how their actions matter to you. When a public official
behaves badly, we’ll expose it. When there’s a story that hasn’t been told, we’ll find it.We strive to hold
powerful people accountable and explain how their actions affect New Jerseyans from Montague to Cape May.
","Prior to the September board meeting, we received an emergency request to support the New Jersey Monitor in its effort to hire healthcare reporter Lilo Stainton, who was laid off from NJ Spotlight following federal funding losses. We requested your support, which the Grants Committee approved for presentation to the full board.
After further discussion with New Jersey Monitor editor Terrence McDonald, it was determined that funds for the planned hire would not be needed until January 2026. To allow time to finalize details with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) contribution of $150K, we agreed to wait until the December grantmaking cycle to award this project - provided all conditions are met.
Since then, RWJF has awarded the Consortium $150,000 over two years to support this position. The Consortium will grant these funds to the New Jersey Monitor over a three-year period. We are now requesting the board’s consideration to supplement this support with an additional $60,000 over three years.

Black in Jersey,"Black In Jersey is a digital storytelling and media production company based in Trenton, New Jersey. The organization coaches citizen journalists to amplify the voices that shape New Jersey, building connections and fostering conversation through news coverage and documentary-style storytelling.

 This renewal focuses on implementing a succession plan that allows Black in Jersey’s founder and editor, Tennyson Donyea, to train his newsroom staff for leadership roles while stepping back from day-to-day operations. Black in Jersey demonstrated significant progress in audience engagement, newsroom growth, and consistency in reporting between June 2024 and June 2025. Tennyson took on a new position this year as an editor of The Baltimore Banner and relocated to the D.C. area to be closer to his new role. As a result, production at Black in Jersey temporarily paused during his transition.

","Black In Jersey’s most notable improvements came through staffing additions. Frank Santos stepped into the leadership role of Head of Creative Marketing. Adrienne Bauldock was brought on to refine the organization’s social media presence and community engagement strategy while taking on a larger role in event coordination.
The publication’s most engaging story focused on Camden and was co-produced by SJIEP fellow Jewel Justice and team member Frank Santos. It covered the environmental hazard caused by the European Metal Recycling Company (EMR), which caught fire and forced thousands of residents to evacuate. Black In Jersey’s team was among the first publications to break the story and was one of the few, if not the only, outlets present at the subsequent hearings and community organizing events around the city’s incinerator. The piece went viral, drawing over 15,000 page views and sparking local action through the Fight Fire with Fire advocacy group formed by local Camden residents.

CCM (Spanish Translation): Montclair State University,"The New Jersey News Commons Spanish Translation News Service (STNS) is a collaborative project launched in July 2022 by the Center for Cooperative Media at Montclair State University. Currently in its third year, STNS aims to bridge the growing information gap for the Spanish-speaking communities in New Jersey by providing translated versions of significant statewide news stories that Spanish-language media might otherwise be unable to publish.  This initiative is designed to assist both Spanish-language news media and major news outlets in New Jersey by fostering partnerships among STNS member organizations. There are nine Spanish-language publications in New Jersey; six of those are part of the STNS project. ","The translated stories now span a broad range of topics, including immigration, education, healthcare, housing, transportation, the economy, and the environment. Since January 2025, heightened federal enforcement actions under the Trump administration have driven an increase in immigration-related arrests at workplaces and other locations, and a significant portion of recent translations has focused on immigration as a result. Over the past three years, interest in republishing STNS translated stories has grown steadily, supported by project leadership’s efforts to standardize translation practices while preserving cultural nuance and linguistic accuracy. This growth in republication across both English- and Spanish-language outlets reflects a wider recognition among English-focused news partners of the importance of Spanish translation in reaching and informing diverse audiences. As of October 2025, approximately 190 stories have been translated into Spanish, and the number of STNS partners has expanded to 19, including seven Spanish-language and 12 English-language organizations.",Approve,$50000.00,Civic news and information reporting,Renewal ,Yes
